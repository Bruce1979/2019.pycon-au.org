title: PyCon AU is this week - important details for attendees
---

PyCon AU is just a few short days away and we know you're just as excited as we are! Earlier today we emailed all registered attendees with important details about tickets, registration and events around the conference. Here's a quick summary in case you missed that email.

## Venue
We’re all heading to the International Convention Centre (ICC), Sydney, Level 3. The ICC is a large complex, but we are in the "conference center", at the far north end right next to the Hard Rock Cafe, the Sofitel, and Convention light-rail station. Read more about how to get to the venue

Registration will be open from 8am for a 9am conference start.

You'll need to present your ticket at registration. Where can you find your ticket? At the bottom of this email!

## New to PyCon AU?
We'll be holding a [First Timer's session at 8:30am on Saturday](https://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/first-timers-session). Whether it's your first or fifth PyCon AU, you're invited to attend.

## Code of Conduct
We remind all attendees at PyCon AU that we operate under a Code of Conduct. Please take the time to read it: [https://2019.pycon-au.org/conduct/](https://2019.pycon-au.org/conduct/)

## Session Chairs
We still have places left for people to help out as Session Chairs. This is a great chance to dip your toe in with volunteering, and meet some of our amazing speakers. We've written up what's involved in being a session chair including how to self-register! Check out the [session chair](https://2019.pycon-au.org/session-chairs/) page for full details.

## Slack
We have a Slack for attendees, which you can join. An invitation link is included in the email sent to you personally and is exclusively for attendees (please do not share it). Please also note that the Slack falls under our Code of Conduct.

## Lightning Talks and Open Spaces
PyCon AU has two lightning talk sessions (Saturday and Sunday afternoon) and submissions to give a lightning talk will be open at the registration desk during morning tea. If you’re thinking of giving a lightning talk, please [read the lightning talks page](https://2019.pycon-au.org/lightning-talks/) for details on how and when to submit.

Open Spaces are attendee-led gatherings, known also as birds of a feather. Read more about [Open Spaces on our events page](https://2019.pycon-au.org/events#open-spaces) (including how to run one). Keep an eye on the attendee slack #openspaces, #pyconau on twitter, and the “Open Spaces” board at registration for community led activities and gatherings throughout the conference.

## Development Sprints
If you have registered for the development sprints on Monday and Tuesday, check out our updated [sprints page](https://2019.pycon-au.org/sprints) that helps you prepare to attend! We’ve provided the space, power and wifi - and this helps you prepare the projects!

## A General Reminder
We want PyCon AU to be an inclusive and welcoming conference for attendees of all backgrounds and levels of experience. This means being a safe space to learn, ask questions, and meet people without being concerned about ridicule, harassment, or being made to feel uncomfortable.

In addition, we remind you that PyCon AU is not primarily a security conference. There are other venues to try your social engineering hacks and lock picking tricks, but this is not it. We ask that attendees do not attack or pentest the conference networks, conference infrastructure, conference processes, or the conference attendees in any way.

Looking forward to seeing you all in Sydney very soon!
