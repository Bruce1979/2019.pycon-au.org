PyCon AU is a successful community-run event which year on year is grateful for [sponsorship](/sponsor) to keep the conference accessible and affordable.

The team which brought the largest PyCon AU to date in 2018 is leading the conference again in 2019. 

Sponsorship packages are available to suit a range of budgets, from small startup to enterprise. Sponsoring PyCon Australia allows companies to boost their exposure to top tier tech talent and support the local developer community. All packages include complimentary professional-level tickets so that your staff can benefit from the conference too!

There are limited opportunities for sponsorship at our highest tiers -- Platinum and Gold -- so get in early to secure these placements.

Sponsors also have additional opportunities to get their name in some very coveted spaces - we have add-on packages for sponsoring attendee lanyards, coffee and catering, among other options.

If you are interested in sponsoring, please [download our sponsor prospectus](/prospectus.pdf) for further details.

We're also happy to consider an in-kind or custom sponsorship request. For any enquiries or questions, please contact [sponsorship@pycon-au.org](mailto:sponsorship@2019.pycon-au.org)
