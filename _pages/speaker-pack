If you’re left with any questions after reading this page, please contact us at <speakers@2019.pycon-au.org> and we will do our best to help you out.

### Talk Duration

Standard length talks run for 30 minutes, including questions.

Deep Dive talks run for 70 minutes, including questions.

Please make sure to **time your talk** *before* you present it on our stage so that you know how long it is going to take to deliver it (and remember that you might speak faster in front of an audience than you would when you practice it by yourself, or in front of friends).

Our audience expects that your talk (plus questions) will take up all of the time allocated. If you have a 30 minute talk space and find that, when you practice it, your talk only goes for ten minutes, take the opportunity to add extra detail. If your talk goes for forty minutes, you might need to cut out a few parts.

You are in charge of allowing time for questions inside your time slot. Often, speakers who choose to take questions will allow 5 minutes for questions.

**Taking questions is not mandatory!**

You can decide how you would like to handle questions about your talk. By default, Session Chairs will assume you are not taking questions. Please tell your Session Chair what your preferences are.

Your Session Chair will sit in the front row and give you time warning cards at 5, 2, and 1 minutes remaining, and STOP when you have hit the end of your speaking time. Please speak with your Session Chair before your talk about any preferences you have for this.

There are 10 minutes between the talks for changeover. Please respect this time limit. Once your slot is over, please collect your things and continue any conversations in the hallway, in order to give the next speaker an equal chance to prepare.

### Display Resolution

We use a strict 16:9 ratio on all displays with 720p resolution (1280 x 720p).

### Video Connections

All rooms will only have HDMI connectors. If you need an adapter to output HDMI, please bring it with you (especially if you are a Mac user or need USB-C connectors). We strongly recommend you bring the power adapter for your device, too.

There will also be an audio connector (headphone/mini-jack). Please let the A/V team know if you are intending on playing audio when setting up for your talk so they can test sound levels before you start.

If you have special requirements beyond this, please get in touch in advance with the AV team lead, Ryan: <ryan@nextdayvideo.com.au> or 0418 186 604.

### Testing Your Laptop

It is recommended that you test your laptop before your talk. A test setup will be available in the **"Org & AV" Room, C3.2**. This will be similar to the podium setup, allowing you to plug your laptop in and check that it works. You can find this room marked on our [venue map](https://2019.pycon-au.org/attend/#venue-map). A helpful volunteer can direct you if you become lost.

### Arrive Early

Please make sure you know when and where your talk is scheduled. Please check the [schedule](https://2019.pycon-au.org/schedule/) to confirm the day, time, and room for which your talk is scheduled.

Since we are so close to the event, we will not be making any more timing changes unless absolutely necessary. If any changes affect you, we will let you know as soon as possible. 

It is essential that you arrive in your talk room in the break before your talk to check in with and meet your Session Chair and A/V team. This will give you time to look at the layout of your room, assess the space, etc. This also makes sure that our volunteers and staff don't panic trying to find you before your talk.

It is also important that you visit our front desk and have your ticket scanned as early as possible during the event, so that we know that you are present. If we don't have you scanned in, and you don't check in with us on the day, we will contact one of our backup speakers to give a talk instead, or update our schedule to reflect that there is no talk at that time, in order ensure that our audiences aren't disappointed and can plan their days properly. (Unfortunately, speakers not showing up on the day, and not letting us know, has happened at previous PyCon AU events. If you are just running late, call us so we know you're still coming! See also *What To Do If Something Comes Up*, below.)


### Slide Tips

Here are some suggestions for slide design that will help you avoid a few common disappointing situations that presenters can face. (We thank previous PyCon AU organisers for this helpful list).

* Ensure that text isn’t too close to the borders or sides of your slides
	* Projectors have a tendency to cut the sides of your slides!
		* Avoid highly indented bullet points;
			* it’s a sign you’re overloading the slide
			* with too much information
				* which can get frustrating.
* Ensure that text is large enough to be readable at a distance (>18 point is usually a good guide). If you can read your slide in the thumbnail preview, that is a good sign.
* Projectors - compared to screens - often have very poor contrast. Just because it looks good on your computer screen doesn't mean it will look good on the projector. * Avoid too many fancy colours - just keep it simple.
* Many people have problems with seeing low contrast colours and images. Please also try to consider colour-blind people when picking colours.
* Spellcheck your presentation.
* Consider using a slide lint tool, such as [SlideLint](http://slidelint.net), to check your slides for many of the above conditions.

More helpful hints can be found in the Writing Slides section of [VM Brasseur’s Public Speaking Resources](https://github.com/vmbrasseur/Public_Speaking#writing-presentations).

### Conduct and Expectations

Please make sure that your talk content and slides comply with the [PyCon AU Code of Conduct](https://2019.pycon-au.org/conduct/). We take our Code of Conduct extremely seriously, and expect all of our speakers to uphold it on our stages.

An important note, particularly for those speaking at the Security and Privacy Track on the Friday: we ask that, as you're planning your security track talks, you:

* Do not include demos where you attack or pentest the conference networks, conference infrastructure, conference processes, or the conference attendees in any way.
* If talking about any past hacks or social engineering, be careful to note clearly in your talk that you had informed consent for any system or person affected.

Any actions that make attendees feel unwelcome or unsafe fall under the Code of Conduct. There's more information here: <https://2019.pycon-au.org/conduct/>.

### Talk Recording

Your talk will be recorded, unless you have opted out of the recording release in your talk proposal form. All recorded talks will be available on the PyCon Australia YouTube channel shortly after the event: <https://www.youtube.com/user/PyConAU>.

We will publish these talks under a [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license.

### Quiet Space

Should you need a quiet place to prepare for the talk, meditate, or unwind, we have a room set aside for this purpose. You can find the **Quiet Room, C3.1**, marked on our [venue map](https://2019.pycon-au.org/attend/#venue-map). Please note that this room is shared with all other conference attendees who may need it, so it is not a good place to rehearse your talk.

### Your Published Talk Details

Your talk information and biography is up on [our website](https://2019.pycon-au.org/schedule/).

Please take the time to look over your talk entry, and make sure that you are happy with your abstract and biography.

Should you wish to update your biography, profile photo, or abstract, please email any changes to <speakers@2019.pycon-au.org> from the same email address you used to submit your talk, or register for the conference. (We are using this email to contact you right now.)

We advise you to send through any changes as soon as possible, ahead of the event, as the organising team will be very busy during the event and will not have time to push website changes outside of egregious errors or emergencies.


### What To Do If Something Comes Up

Sometimes things happen!

Laptops run out of power, slides go missing, transport runs late, family stuff comes up, physical or mental health problems can occur. If anything comes up at any point, please let Lilly (our Papers Chair) or one of the other conference organisers know. We have an experienced organising team who can help with a broad range of questions, issues, or concerns. The sooner you let us know if there is a problem, the sooner we can work with you to achieve the best possible outcome.

If you’re just unsure and need to clarify something, use the Attendee Slack (details to come) or email <speakers@2019.pycon-au.org>. 

If you are having an urgent problem relating to conference logistics, please contact Lilly Ryan or Katie McLaughlin (phone numbers have been emailed to speakers already). Less immediate issues can be directed to a Volunteer, A/V Team member, or Organiser, as appropriate. 

If you have an issue that should involve our Conduct Team, a 24-hour hotline number will be made available at the event. Less immediate issues of Conduct can be emailed to <safety@2019.pycon-au.org>. Signs with these details will be around the venue. 

If you have an immediate safety concern, please contact venue Security, or Emergency Services (000).
