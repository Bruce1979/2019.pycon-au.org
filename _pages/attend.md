## Coming soon

Ticket sales are not open yet and the full detail of the schedule can only be available once the talk selection has been finalised, but here's roughly how it'll look. Don't forget to keep the evenings free, this is a conference where people talk to each other and hang out in the evenings.

### Friday, August 2: Specialist track day

PyCon AU kicks off with a day for attendees interested in specialist fields. It runs just like a main conference day, any attendees on this day are welcome to attend talks from any or all of the tracks, you can pick and choose and the talk schedules will line up nicely to let you do that.

With four very different tracks there's something for everyone and each track will have a mix of beginner friendly and in-depth specialist talks. The four tracks are:

* [Security and Privacy Track](/security-and-privacy-track)
* [DjangoCon AU](/djangoconau/)
* [Education Track](/education-track)
* [Science and Data Track](/science-and-data-track)

Talks for these specialist tracks go through the same submission process as talks for the main conference days. Each track is organised by specialists in their field, the talks are selected from all submissions by the track organisers in coordination with the program committee.

### Sat/Sun, August 3-4: Main Conference

This is the core of PyCon AU, as each day kicks off with an amazing keynote speaker, followed by 4 tracks of talks on a diverse range of Python related topics. There will be a mix of beginner friendly and advanced talks on both technical and non-technical topics, with four tracks there'll always be something you're interested to see. This year we're adding in [deep dive talks](/news/deep-dive-talks/) to make extra space for some deep and advanced Python goodness.

The end of the day brings everyone together again for a hilarious and informative round of lightning talks (submission of lightning talks topics will be open during the conference).


### Mon/Tue, August 5-6: Development Sprints

Python wouldn't have gotten to where it is without a welcoming community of developers building cool things together. The development sprints are an open space for people to work on projects with a particular focus on open source projects. 

The sprints are a place for everyone from experienced open source contributors to interested first-time contributors and anyone really! Maybe you want to hang out and try out an idea you have, maybe you'd like to find collaborators for a project you want to start, maybe you'd like someone to help you through your first attempts at open source. We'll provide tables, chairs, wifi, power and a community of supportive developers.
