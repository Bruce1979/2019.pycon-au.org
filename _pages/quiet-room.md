Should you need a quiet place to prepare for your talk (if you're a speaker), meditate, or unwind, we have a room set aside for this purpose. You can find the **Quiet Room, C3.1**, marked on our [venue map](https://2019.pycon-au.org/attend/#venue-map). 


Speakers: Please note that this room is shared with all other conference attendees who may need it, so it is not a good place to rehearse your talk.
