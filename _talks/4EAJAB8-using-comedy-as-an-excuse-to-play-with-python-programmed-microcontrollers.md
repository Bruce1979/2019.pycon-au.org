      Early-career comedians often have difficulties adding electronic props to their acts, due to the high cost of materials and fabrication skills required. This talk will recreate several props used in comedic performances, showing the code and components used.

Debbie Zukerman wanted to kit out her comedy shows with fancy tech but had neither the money nor the skills. In stepped Anthony Joseph, who invented some magic wands and a costume that lights up when you clap. They're going to show you how he did it using microcontrollers and python. Anthony has re-created some common comedic props such as:

- a magic wand,
- a spinning bow-tie,
- a theremin, and
- a sound-sensitive light costume.

Debbie will talk about some of challenges early-career comedians may face, and the technologies comedians use in their acts. Anthony will also demonstrate a new tool that can be used by independent performers to organise their acts.
