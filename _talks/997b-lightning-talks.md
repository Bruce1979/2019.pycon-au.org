      bio: The Lightning Talk Tzar is the Master of Ceremonies for a session of Lightning talks. Their skills include introducing the current speaker, pre-announcing the next speaker (getting them to start their setup), starting timers, and leading the crowd in a rousing applause should the timer reach '0:00'. 
    
 
abstract: Lightning talks are 5 minute talks. You have 5 minutes. 5 shall be the number, and the number shall be 5. 6 is too much.
