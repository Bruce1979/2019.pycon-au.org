The PyCon AU organising team is committed to make PyCon AU an inclusive and welcoming place for everyone. Even then, a large conference with hundreds of people can be a little intimidating. This first timers session is here to help.

If you're new to PyCon, we've got some suggestions for how you can get the most out of the conference. Attending PyCon AU is not just about watching talks, there are opportunities to participate more fully.

Even if this is not your first PyCon rodeo, come along to find out how you can help make PyCon AU a great expereience for the first timers, and be a friendly first person to meet.
