    For the Data Science community, Python is the language of choice. If you're processing and understanding data, be it statistical analysis, visualisation or machine learning then there's a plethora of Python based tools available to you. The Data Science track is for people in the data science industry, in academia or generally interested in using Python to gain insights from your data.
