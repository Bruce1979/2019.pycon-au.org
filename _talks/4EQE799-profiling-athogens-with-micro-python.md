- biography: 'Embedded developer by day, electronics and software tinkerer by night,
    I''ve been building stuff my whole life.


    I''ve got an background in science and electronics engineering but have been mostly
    working in c/c++ in hardware and python on desktop/server for the last 6 years.
    In the past year I''ve brought these two fields together through micropython!'

      We're building professional medical diagnostics equipment with micropython. This has come with minimal challenges, many positives and a few surprises!

At work I was successfully able to petition for the use of micropython to build a new medical products design, even though no one had used it internally for anything "real" before, not even a test rig. 
I'd like to share how easy this was to do, even in such a traditionally conservative field, and take listeners on a journey from product conception through prototype, build, integration and clinical trials, with some of our own internal trials along the way. 
This project has required our embedded developers to really change the way they do things, mostly for the better, and has enabled (if not forced) us to contribute a number of features back to mainline micropython.
We've had a lot of learnings I'd like to share along with a new way to build a huge range of exciting products leaveraging the power of (micro)python,  hopefully I can inspire others to follow suit!
