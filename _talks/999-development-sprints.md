Development Sprints, also known as just 'sprints', are an unstructured session where attendees can work on projects with peers, hack on things, or see what others are working on.

PyCon AU will provide the space, power, and internet, you provide the projects.

There will be a "Development Sprints" wall at registration where you can list your project throughout the conference. We'll also hold a brief project/idea pitch at the beginning of the sprints where everyone will have the opportunity to announce what projects they're working on.

Sprints are not fully catered, however just across the way from the Convention Centre is Harbourside, a shopping complex that has mulitple foodcourts and restaurants. There is also a Coles and several convenience stores within walking distance for snacks.

If you've registered for the sprints but you're still not sure if you should attend, [Naomi Ceder](https://pycon.blogspot.com/2016/03/why-not-join-sprints-this-year-at-pycon.html) has written a post about why you should sprint at PyCon, and the same holds true for PyCon AU's sprints.

## Tips to prepare for the sprints

### For attendees bringing projects

Development sprints are often a chance for attendees to make their first open source contribution. If you're bringing a project with you, here are a few tips to help prepare for the sprints in advance and make the most of the 2 days of community coding!

* Prepare a list of first-timer features or issues. If this is in GitHub we recommend having an issues list that is appropriately tagged.
* Have an elevator pitch ready that explains what your project does, what contributions you're looking for _and what things you can teach contributors_.
* Bring an open mind and welcome _all_ sorts of contributions. Our confence has attendees from all walks of life and they can contribute many things to your projects _including things that aren't lines of code_. Be open to suggestions of documentation, diagrams, editing or usability feedback!

To help find contributors and raise interest for your project, write up your project details and place it on the "Development Sprints" wall at registration so that attendees can peruse throughout the conference.

### Finding a project to work on

If you're coming to the sprints but you're not sure what to work on, thats absolutely OK! Here are a few tips to help you get started:

* Visit the registration desk and check out the listed projects on the "Development Sprints" wall.
* Keep an eye out on twitter #pyconau and the attendee slack for people sharing their projects. Perhaps speak to them in the hallway over the weekend before attending the sprints
* Be prepared with an elevator pitch for the types of projects that interest you, the skills you want to learn, or the skills that you'd like to share!
